<h2>Deployment</h2>
frontend is hosted on vercel here https://store-ashen-psi.vercel.app/
backend is hosted on fly at https://little-violet-3254.fly.dev/
to login to the backend and manage users, data, apis, go to https://little-violet-3254.fly.dev/_/


<h2>About</h2>
The project was made because my friend wanted a site to start an online bussiness. The products on the page aren't actually for sale because the store didn't pan out. But if it did this is what the site would've looked like.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
The UI of the page was greatly enhanced with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI. This project was basically a chance to practice my frontend and design skills. As the backend, authentication, db, api routes were mainly done by pocketbase. This was done because I had a deadline and wanted to build fast.

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
The hardest thing about this project was honestly deploying it. I'm used to Create React App(CRA), and netlify so my plan was to use npm run build and upload that build file to netlify. But it took so long and things kept breaking. I even tried deploy through vercel via github but that didn't work either. Good thing I wanted to practice using Next, as it made deployment through the cli much easier. The joy and happiness I felt when the site was finally live is why I continue to code.

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
This site has authentication, and data is managed well. The only thing it lacks is the cart and payment processing which is what I'll be working on. Because who knows maybe my friend will come back and ask about an ecomerce site again, and I'll be ready.
